f it we're back to 3mux
https://github.com/aaronjanse/3mux

remap modifiers to use command as alt:
https://iterm2.com/documentation-preferences-keys.html
Also to use option as alt, change profile -> keys to remap as esc+
NOTE: What I really want is not to remap, just to get certain key combos
working. Will need to enumerate these for i3 shortcuts, but most likely:
meta+enter
meta+hjkl
meta+shift+hjkl
meta+v, h?
meta+semicolon split h
meta+swe
resize mode meta+r
